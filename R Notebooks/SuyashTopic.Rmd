The equations we seen till now, we can represented using the matrix notation.
The bottom-level series' aggregation is determined by a n m matrix S, often known as the "summing matrix," which is created for each aggregation structure.

![Example1](https://otexts.com/fpp3/figs/hts.png)

we can represent the above example into the matrix as follows:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_{t} \\
    y{A}{t} \\
    y{B}{t} \\
    y{AA}{t} \\
    y{AB}{t} \\
    y{AC}{t} \\
    y{BA}{t} \\
    y{BB}{t}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    1  & 0  & 0  & 0  & 0  \\
    0  & 1  & 0  & 0  & 0  \\
    0  & 0  & 1  & 0  & 0  \\
    0  & 0  & 0  & 1  & 0  \\
    0  & 0  & 0  & 0  & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    y{AA}{t} \\
    y{AB}{t} \\
    y{AC}{t} \\
    y{BA}{t} \\
    y{BB}{t}
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

or we can represent that into very small equation:
$$
\begin{equation}
  {y}_t={S}{b}_{t}
\end{equation}
$$

where y t is an n-dimensional vector of all the observations in the hierarchy at time t, S is the summing matrix, and b t is an m-dimensional vector of all the observations at the lowest level of the hierarchy at time t. The first row of the summation matrix S reflects 
$$
\begin{equation}
  y_{t}=y{AA}{t}+y{AB}{t}+y{AC}{t}+y{BA}{t}+y{BB}{t},
\end{equation}
$$
, whereas the second and third rows represent
$$
\begin{equation}
  y{A}{t}=y{AA}{t}+y{AB}{t}+y{AC}{t}\qquad \text{and} \qquad  y{B}{t}=y{BA}{t}+y{BB}{t}.
\end{equation}
$$
. The rows below these form an m-dimensional identity matrix I m, with each bottom-level observation on the right side of the equation equal to itself on the left side.


Similarly,for the given figure
![example 2](https://otexts.com/fpp3/fpp_files/figure-html/GroupTree-1.png)

The given matrix is as follows:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    y_{t} \\
    y{A}{t} \\
    y{B}{t} \\
    y{X}{t} \\
    y{Y}{t} \\
    y{AX}{t} \\
    y{AY}{t} \\
    y{BX}{t} \\
    y{BY}{t}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    y{AX}{t} \\
    y{AY}{t} \\
    y{BX}{t} \\
    y{BY}{t}
  \end{bmatrix},
$$
or the equation same as,

$$
\begin{equation}
  {y}_t={S}{b}_{t}
\end{equation}
$$

where the second and third rows of S represent Equation 
$$
\begin{equation} y{A}{t}=y{AX}{t}+y{AY}{t}\quad \quad y{B}{t}=y{BX}{t}+y{BY}{t}
\end{equation}
$$
and the fourth and fifth rows represent 
$$
\begin{equation} y{X}{t}=y{AX}{t}+y{BX}{t}\quad \quad y{Y}{t}=y{AY}{t}+y{BY}{t}
\end{equation}
$$.

This matrix notation enables us to use a single notation to express all forecasting methods for hierarchical or clustered time series.

Assume we anticipate all series without regard for any aggregation limitations. These are the basic predictions, and they are denoted by $\hat{{y}}_h$, where h is the forecast horizon. They are stacked in the same sequence as the data ${y}_t.$

Hence, for either hierarchical or grouped systems, all coherent forecasting techniques may be described as

\begin{equation}
  \tilde{{y}}_h={S}{G}\hat{{y}}_h,
  
\end{equation}

where G is a matrix that transfers the base forecasts to the bottom level and S sums them together using the aggregation structure to obtain a set of coherent forecasts $\tilde{{y}}_h$. 

The G matrix is defined in accordance with the technique used. For example, if the bottom-up technique is applied to anticipate the example 1 hierarchy, then
$$
{G}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
  \end{bmatrix}
$$.

Take note that G has two partitions. The first three columns zero out the series' base forecasts above the bottom level, while the m-dimensional identity matrix selects just the bottom level's base forecasts. The S matrix then adds them all together.

If one of the top-down approach was adopted,
$$
{G}=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      p_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      p_2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      p_3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      p_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
      p_5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    \end{bmatrix}.
$$


The first column contains the set of proportions that allocate the top level's base predictions to the lower level. The S matrix then adds them all together. The remaining columns subtract the base projections from the highest degree of aggregation.

The G matrix for a middle out strategy will be a hybrid of the two above. The base predictions of a pre-selected level will be disaggregated to the bottom level using a set of proportions, all other base forecasts will be wiped out, and the bottom-level forecasts will then be summed up the hierarchy using the summing matrix.
